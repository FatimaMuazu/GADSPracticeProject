##Lab Objectives:
	-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using Googple Cloud Platform Console.
	-Create a Comput Engine virtual machine using thr gcloud command-line interface.
	-Connect between the two instances.

1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using Googple Cloud Platform Console.
	
		gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" 
		--subnet "default" --tags http

2. Create a Comput Engine virtual machine using thr gcloud command-line interface.
		
		gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b 
		
		gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" 
		--subnet "default" 
	
3. Connect between the two instances.
		i. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
			-connect to my-vm-2:
				
				gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
				
			-ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
				
				ping my-vm-1
			
			-Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
				
				ssh my-vm-1
			
			-At the prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
				
				sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
			
			-Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
				
				sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
			
			-Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
				
				Hi from Fatima
				
			-Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
			
			-Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
			
				curl http://localhost/
				
			-To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
				
				exit
			
			-To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
				
				curl http://my-vm-1/
