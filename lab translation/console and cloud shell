#Console and Cloud Shell
##Lab Objectives
	
	-Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

	-Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

	-Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

Steps

1. Create a storage bucket
	
	i.In the Google Cloud menu, click Activate Cloud Shell 
	
	ii. use the following command in the cloud shell to set environment for your project 
		
		gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
	
	iii. Use the gsutil command to create a bucket. Replace <BUCKET_NAME> with a globally unique name
		
		gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
2. Upload files to cloud storage bucket

	i. to upload a file to the bucket created use the gsutil command where [MY_FILE] is the file to upload to the bucket
		
		gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
	
3. Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
	
	i. To display available regions, run the following gcloud command
		
		gcloud compute regions list
		
	ii. To create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step
		
		INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]
	
	iii. To create a subdirectory for materials used in this class

		 mkdir infraclass
		
	iv. To create a file called config in the infraclass directory

		 touch infraclass/config
		 
	v. To append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file

		 echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
		 
	vi. To create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replace [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID
		 
		 INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
	
	vii.To append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file

		 echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

	viii.To verify that the project variable was set
		 
		 source infraclass/config
		 echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
